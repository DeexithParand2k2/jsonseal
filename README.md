## Design choices

- Writing custom validators should be easy: just write a `func() error`, you got one!
- In case of a validation error, provide a way to capture information about where the error occured.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/scriptnull/jsonseal
```

## Example

Consider the following JSON, that could arrive in a web request for performing payments.

```js
// TODO
```

There are many aspects about this JSON that we would like to validate.

```go
// TODO
```
